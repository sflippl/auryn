Description: The auryn library (https://github.com/fzenke/auryn) simulates 
    spiking neural networks with synaptic plasticity. It is written in C++ and 
    its usage requires specification of a compiled program. This package aims to
    make auryn more accessible to non-programmers by providing service functions
    and exposing as much of its functionality in an accessible R interface as 
    possible.
